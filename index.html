      <p><em>Front End Software Developer</em></p>
      
      <p>Welcome to my portfolio! I'm Natalie, and I have recently entered the software development<br> 
         industry. I'm currently studying Front End Development at Promineo Tech, a coding bootcamp<br>
         partnering with Nashville State Community College.</p> 

      <p>I first had the opportunity to develop a website for a class at MTSU. But it was after I 
         assisted<br> the Nashville City Cemetery with their website that I became interested in
         coding and front<br>end development.</p>
      
      <p>I'm enjoying the program at Promineo Tech. It has given me the opportunity to learn about 
         JavaScript,<br>HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and React. In my free time, I enjoy crocheting, reading 
         mysteries and sci-fi/<br>fantasy, and writing short stories. You can connect with me on 
         <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/natalie-goodwin/">LinkedIn</a> and 
         <a href="https://github.com/natalie-goodwin">GitHub</a>.</p>
